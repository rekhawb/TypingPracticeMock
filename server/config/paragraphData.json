The wind, rain, loud noises, and flashes of light can cause sensory overload. This can cause a reluctance to leave the house, reluctance to go outdoors, or perpetual checking of the weather. But if you understand what's happening, that fear can turn into wonder. Nature is amazing!"

Massive sequencing efforts are used to identify previously unknown point mutations in a variety of genes in cancer. Bioinformaticians continue to produce specialized automated systems to manage the sheer volume of sequence data produced, and they create new algorithms and software to compare the sequencing results to the growing collection of human genome sequences and germline polymorphisms."
